        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-primary-600">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            EventHub was founded in 2023 by a group of community organizers who were frustrated with 
            the complexity of existing event platforms. We set out to create something simple, 
            accessible, and focused on local communities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
            Since then, we've helped thousands of events reach their audiences and connected 
            countless people with experiences that matter to them.
